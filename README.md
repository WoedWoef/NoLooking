# NoLooksies
Closes leagueclient when a Solo/Duo ranked game ends, so you can't see your lp gains or losses.

## Install:
Download the NoLooksies.exe file from the latest release!
https://github.com/WoedWoef/NoLooksies/releases/tag/v2.0.0

Extract and place the file somewhere on ur pc.
You can now start the NoLooksies.exe file!

## Usage:

When you start the app it becomes a tray icon so you can see it in the bottom right in your task bar.
The app will now check if u'r for the ending of a solo duo ranked game, if it finds one, it will shut down the client so that you cannot see the lp change, and you have to make a conscious decision to play another!
The app will keep running and looking for new ranked games even when the client closes.


## Options:

Toggle program - Starts and stops the programs functionality, defaults to ON
 

Start on windows startup = <On/Off> - click to toggle the application to start automatically when your pc starts, defaults to OFF

 
Quit - Quits program


## Windows pop-up:
If you get a windows smartscreen pop-up with:
 
> *Windows protected your PC:*
 
> *Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk.*


You can press *More Info* and then *Run Anyway* to start the program regardless.

### Reason for pop-up:
This popup is given because my application is not signed by a CA and therefore not recognized as an often used app by Windows.
Fixing this would require buying a cerficate which would cost a lot of money that I don't have.

It is signed and timestamped by me though:
