# NoLooking
Closes leagueclient when a game ends, so you can't see your lp gains or losses.

Install:
Go to releases on the right side of the screen, click on the highlighted NoLooking.zip file.
Unzip the folder and place it somewhere on your pc.

Usage:
When you start the app it becomes a tray icon so you can see it in the bottom right in your task bar.
When you right click it it gives you 4 options:
  Start - starts scanning for active games so it can terminate the client when they finish (enabled by default)
  Stop - stops scanning, useful for norms or games with friends so you can honor them and stuff
  Bring to foreground - does what it says
  Exit - exits program (only way to close it, the red X when you bring it foreground will just minimize it)
