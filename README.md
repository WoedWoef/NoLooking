# NoLooksies
Closes leagueclient when a game ends, so you can't see your lp gains or losses.

##Install:
Download the NoLooksies.exe file from the latest release!
https://github.com/WoedWoef/NoLooksies/releases/tag/v2.0.0

Extract and place the folder inside somewhere on ur pc.
You can now start the NoLooksies.exe file!

##Usage:

When you start the app it becomes a tray icon so you can see it in the bottom right in your task bar.
The app will now check if u'r for the ending of a solo duo ranked game, if it finds one, it will shut down the client so that you cannot see the lp change, and you have to make a conscious decision to play another!



##Options:

Toggle program - Starts and stops the programs functionality, defaults to ON

Start on windows startup = <On/Off> - click to toggle the application to start automatically when your pc starts, defaults to OFF

Quit - Quits program


##Potential issue:
If you get a windows smartscreen pop-up with: "Windows protected your PC
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk."
Press more info and run anyway.
This popup is given because my application is not signed by a CA, which would cost me a lot of money that i don't have. 
It is signed and timestamped by me though, in the smartscreen popup the publisher should say: 76c9f72e-fa22-480a-930a-4e0ed44b9843
